Write a program that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1...9]. The program reads a digit as an input. If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiply it by 100; if it is between 7 and 9, multiply it by 1000. If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program must report an error. Use a switch statement to solve this exercise.
