This project was really fun and I really felt as if it tested the limits of my understanding of Javascript.
It forced me to get way better at accessing local storage and making my code simpler and easier to understand. 
Personally I think my design skills could be a lot better, but I really wanted to just demonstrate my JS in this project.
Other than that I think I need to work on the redundancy of my code, and figuring out simpler ways to do what I am trying to do.
I am personally proud as the webpage works completely as intended, maybe even better than I had in mind originally!
If I did a project like this again I would definitely think a lot of it out further in advance, like how I originally tried to assign a variable
to the user depending on if they were logged in and the tasks they had. I would also write a lot less notes on each of the functions
I tend to overexplain and I think it can make it take longer than it needs to.
